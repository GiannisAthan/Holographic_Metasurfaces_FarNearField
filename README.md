# Holographic_Metasurfaces_FarNearField
The above files contain MATLAB code reffering to the overall reaction of a user integrated Metasurface to an incident wave (Spherical/Plane). The user can manipulate the values of the Incident and Scattering Wave as well as the configuration of the Metasurface in order to study any possible outcame with the assistance of 3D and 2D plot diagrams. This is made possible with the use of the Huygens â€“ Fresnel Principle for both Near & Far Field applications.

Basic Principales
- The programme is desinged to handle 4 possible Fields:
    1) Far-Field 2 Far-Field
    2) Far-Field 2 Near-Field
    3) Near-Field 2 Far-Field
    4) Near-Field 2 Near-Field
 
- According to the desired fields we want to work on we will have to provide the according inputs for the Incident Wave.
  1) Far-field in the Incident Wave field meaning we want a Plane Wave
  2) Near-field in the Incident Wave for a spherical Wave
 
- Using this programme we have the ability to create an MxN Metasurface with the unit cell size of our desire (Du).

- According to the Reflected Wave we want to study we meet the following instances:
  1) For a Far-Field Reflacted Wave
     a) Beam Splitting. In this programme we have the ability either to ask where we want the split beams to appear or how many lobes we want to be formed.
     b) Beam Steering. The reflected Wave could be orianted to any direction.
     c) Diffused Scattering.
     d) Beam Collumnation.

These files are part of my thesis with the title Analysis and design of holographic metasurfaces and study of their applications in wireless mobile telecommunication at microwave and millimeter frequencies (The published work: https://dspace.uowm.gr/xmlui/handle/123456789/5160). It was done under the supervision of postdoc researcher Alexandros Pitilakis (https://github.com/alexpiti), who also provided me with the permission of using some of his posted MATLAB work (https://github.com/alexpiti/Calc-ScatPat & https://github.com/alexpiti/Plot-Pattern).
